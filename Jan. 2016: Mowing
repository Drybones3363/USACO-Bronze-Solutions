#Problem: Linez
<file>
Hint: Don't look where "flag" is spelled horizontally...

#Solution:
```python
file=open("tr011.txt","r")
x=list()
with open("tr011.txt","r") as f:
    y=0
    
    while(y<195):
        z=f.readline()
        if y%5==0:
            x.append(z[0:len(z)-2])
        y+=1
print " ".join(x)
```
flag{a11thetime}
